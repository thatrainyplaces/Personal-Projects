Hello! You can call me Rain for short.

I am a self-learned programmer with my main focus on game development. I am capable to write codes in Python and C#.
For web development I am capable to use HTML, CSS, and JS to build it, although I am still learning on that field.
This repository will be a mix of my personal project, testing, and or not limited to random stuffs that I just wanted 
to try out. I hope that I can maintain my workflow and produce consistent small scale projects and finish it on a
regular basis. I also hope that I will be able to extend my knowledge and skills in programming even more by regularly 
training and exercise in this field. I wish to be able to create video games of my dream someday and build my own studio.

I guess that is enough for a little bit of introduction about myself.
If you're reading this that means you're either a random person that happen to lay your eyes on one of my projects.
Or my future self looking back at the things that I've done before in the past and reminiscing about it.
Either way, thank you and welcome.

Let's get some works done shall we?
